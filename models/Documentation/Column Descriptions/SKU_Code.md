### Nature
This Column acts as a **Primary Key** for The Cocacola Products 


### Business Description  

SKU codes are important because they can help online stores:

* Minimize the number of errors generated during the picking and packing
* Speed up the picking and packing of products
* Provide a more accurate overview of the number of items in the warehouse
* Maximize warehouse resources, ensuring an optimal stock level
* Give insights about what sizes or colors are the most and least sold
* Ensure more traceability throughout the supply chain

### Example
A SKU code for a black T-shirt of size S can be TSH-000-S. The same T-shirt in a different size can be TSH-000-M. If the T-shirt is white and size M, the SKU code can be TSH-FFF-M.
